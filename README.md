# PlaylistAbandoner

Normally when you click a video on a YouTube playlist page, the video plays in
the context of the playlist, meaning the next video will play automatically
when the current video ends.

Playlist Abandoner is a Safari/Chrome extension which adds a button to each video
on a playlist page. Clicking that button will open the video on the normal watch
page, _outside_ the context of the playlist.

The Chrome version of the extension is available [on the Chrome webstore][chrome].

## Installation (Safari)

To install in Safari, download the `.safariextz` file from the [latest release][release]
and double-click it. Safari will ask if you trust the extension before installing.
